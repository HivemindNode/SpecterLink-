# SpecterLink.py  
_A frequency-hopping, ephemeral RF network for undetectable communication._  

### What It Does:  
- **Creates an RF network that constantly changes frequencies to prevent tracking**  
- **Synchronizes devices without fixed beacons or identifiable transmissions**  
- **Ensures messages can be exchanged without leaving a persistent signal trail**  
- **Allows stealth communication between devices even under surveillance**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A signal that never stays in one place  
Is a signal that cannot be intercepted."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **SpecterLink** on multiple T-Embed CC1101 modules  
2. Start the ephemeral network:  
   ```bash
   python3 SpecterLink.py --start
